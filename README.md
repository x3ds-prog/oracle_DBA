# Oracle DBA for Linux Admins: A Practical Guide

Welcome! This course is designed specifically for Linux System Administrators who want to master the fundamentals of Oracle Database Administration. If you're comfortable in the shell, know your way around `grep`, `awk`, and `/proc`, but feel a bit lost when you hear "tablespace" or "execution plan," you're in the right place.

Our philosophy is to learn Oracle by drawing parallels to the Linux concepts you already know and trust. We will translate complex DBA jargon into the language of system administration.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into several modules, each building upon the last. It's recommended to follow them in order.

*   **[00_Introduction_and_Setup](./00_Introduction_and_Setup/)**: Get your lab environment running using Docker, the same way you'd spin up any other service.
*   **[01_SQL_Fundamentals](./01_SQL_Fundamentals/)**: Learn the language of data. We'll cover the essential SQL commands you need to query and understand the data within the database.
*   **[02_Advanced_SQL](./02_Advanced_SQL/)**: Move beyond simple queries. We'll explore how to combine data from multiple sources (`JOINs`) and how to aggregate and report on it (`GROUP BY`).
*   **[03_Database_Internals](./03_Database_Internals/)**: Look under the hood. We'll explore how Oracle physically stores data, uses indexes, and manages transactions, all through the lens of a sysadmin.
*   **[04_Practical_DBA_Tasks](./04_Practical_DBA_Tasks/)**: Start acting like a DBA. Learn how to diagnose slow queries and handle common concurrency problems.

## How to Use This Course

Each module contains a series of articles. Read them sequentially, and most importantly, **run the code examples yourself**. The best way to learn is by doing. The commands are designed to be run in the Oracle lab environment we set up in the first module.
